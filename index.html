        On a daily basis, That’s Math sends easy to read math statements to parents as text
        messages. These statements are aligned with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)
        and demonstrate that math can be experienced in a positive, no-stress way.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In 1961, pioneer researcher Albert Bandura began work on Social Learning Theory. Over the past six decades we’ve learned that children’s actions reflect the actions of their role models and parents more strongly than written or verbal instructions. Parents often send mixed messages about math to their kids. They might tell the child, “Math is important!” while modeling negative thoughts like “I don’t like math” or “I’m bad at math.” Research shows that behavior carries more weight than verbal directives. That’s Math aims to change the gateway to learning: social behavior.

        ~C. Gell, Parent
        In response to the math statement:
        Say, “Shapes and solids are all around
        us. A round rug is a flat round shape and
        a ball is a round shape that’s a solid.”
