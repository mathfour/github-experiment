<div class="areaTitle">Why It Works
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In 1961, pioneer researcher Albert Bandura began work on Social Learning Theory. Over the past six decades we’ve learned that children’s actions reflect the actions of their role models and parents more strongly than written or verbal instructions. Parents often send mixed messages about math to their kids. They might tell the child, “Math is important!” while modeling negative thoughts like “I don’t like math” or “I’m bad at math.” Research shows that behavior carries more weight than verbal directives. That’s Math aims to change the gateway to learning: social behavior.

        In response to the math statement:
        Say, “Shapes and solids are all around
        us. A round rug is a flat round shape and
        a ball is a round shape that’s a solid.”

    <div class="content"><p>Researchers have confirmed through brain scans that merely the thought of solving math problems can cause math anxiety for some students.</p>
    
        <p>When a highly math-anxious student doesn’t perform as expected on a math exam, it could be due to math anxiety or lack of competency due to math avoidance.</p>
    
        <p>That’s Math brings math into the home, making it as familiar a topic as what’s for dinner. This familiarity can reduce anxiety and stop the anxiety-low performance cycle in students, families and communities.</p></div>
